# travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_qt_ldtp

Minimal project that uses qmake, GCC, C++11, Qt, does UI testing using LDTP and is tested by Travis CI

I could not get this to work. A working approach for testing Qt GUI classes is using QTest: [travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_qt_qtest](https://www.github.com/richelbilderbeek/travis_qmake_gcc_cpp11_qt_qtest).
